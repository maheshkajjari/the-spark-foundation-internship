Task-1 - Predicting the percentage of an student based on the number of study hours.

*This task involves Prediction using Supervised ML,This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.
Task-2 - From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, Predicting the optimum number of clusters and representing it visually.

*This task involves Prediction using Unsupervised ML, In this we used K-Means Algorithm to predict the clusters.
Task-3 - Performing ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’.

*This task involves Exploratory Data Analysis, In this we have to derive all the business problems by exploring the data thoroughly.
Task-4 - Performing ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘Global Terrorism’.

*This task also involves Exploratory Data Analysis, In this we have to findout the hotzone of terrorism and all security issues found by doing EDA.
Task-5 - Performing ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘Indian Premier League’.

*This task involves data analysis to findout several insights from the cricket data.
Task-6 - Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm.

*The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
